C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Palindrome or Not

This program reverses an integer (entered by the user) using while loop. Then, if statement is used to check whether the reversed number is equal to the original number or not.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C++ programming topics:

C++ while and do...while Loop

C++ if, if...else and Nested if...else

This program takes an integer from user and that integer is reversed.

If the reversed integer is equal to the integer entered by user then, that number is a palindrome if not that number is not a palindrome.

Example: Check Palindrome Number

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

     int n, num, digit, rev = 0;

     cout << "Enter a positive number: ";

     cin >> num;

     n = num;

     do

     {

         digit = num % 10;

         rev = (rev * 10) + digit;

         num = num / 10;

     } while (num != 0);

     cout << " The reverse of the number is: " << rev << endl;

     if (n == rev)

         cout << " The number is a palindrome.";

     else

         cout << " The number is not a palindrome.";

    return 0;

}
